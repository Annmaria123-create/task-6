# üõí Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains a dataset and BigQuery SQL analysis focused on sales performance across products, regions, and time periods.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes sales transactions with details such as product category, region, sales representative, discounts, and unit pricing.

**Filename:** `salesdata.csv`
We use SQL in **Google BigQuery** to:

- Summarize revenue by **region**, **quarter**, and **sales rep**
- Compare **quarterly performance** (e.g., Q1 vs Q2 of 2023)
- Analyze trends across **months**, **sales channels**, and **customer types**
